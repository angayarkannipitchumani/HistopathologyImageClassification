# HistopathologyImageClassification
The hybriddeep learning model is proposed for selecting abstract features from thehistopathology images. In the proposed approach we have concatenated two differentCNN architecture into a single model for effective classification of mitotic cells.Convolution Neural Network (CNN) automatically detects efficient features withouthuman intervention and classifies cancerous and non-cancerous images using a hybridfully connected network. It is a computationally efficient, very powerful, and efficientmodel for performing automatic feature extraction. It detects different phenotypicsignatures of nuclei. In order to enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency thehistopathology images are preprocessed, segmented and feature extracted throughCNN and fed into a hybrid CNN for classification. The Hybrid CNN is obtained byconcatenating two CNN models together this is called model leveraging. Modelaveraging can be improved by weighting the contributions of each sub-model to thecombined prediction by the expected performance of the sub model. The proposedhybrid CNN architecture with data preprocessing with median filter and Otsu basedsegmentation technique is trained using 50,000 images and tested using 50,000images. It provides an overall accuracy of 98.9%
